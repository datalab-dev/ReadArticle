# Goals for the ReadArticle package

Given bounding boxes already parsed by GetDocElements, extract
elements that are particular to articles, including:

  + abstracts
  
  + submission, acceptance, and publication dates
  
  + authors and affiliations
  
  + bibliography
  
  + metadata from publishers (Elsiever, BioOne, etc.)
